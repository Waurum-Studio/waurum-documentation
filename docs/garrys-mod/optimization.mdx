## Switch to Chromium branch

:::tip What is Chromium?
**Chromium is an alternative branch** of Garry's mod that features an **improved HTML engine** but also **latest updates**.  
It is known to bring a **performance boost** at the cost of really rare crashs due to its **experimental** aspect.  
**Most players and developers use it instead of the default branch of the game.** 
:::

### Change of branch
1. **Open Steam**, go in your **library** and **click on Garry's mod**
2. Hit the **Cog button** *(Manage)* and click on ``Properties...``

**Select the ``64-bit`` one** and click **Play** to launch Garry's mod.

:::danger Disclaimer
**This is the most "technical" part of this tutorial**, but if you follow steps correctly, it should be okay.

:::

> *In your Steam library, go to ``Manage / Properties / Local files / Browse Local Files``*
2. **Go in** ``garrysmod/cfg`` folder
3. **Open** ``autoexec.cfg`` file with a text editor *(Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime text, etc..)*
> *If file doesn't exist for whatever reason, create it*
4. **Copy the following code block** and **paste it** into the ``autoexec.cfg`` file
```lua
// Multi-core rendering settings
// highlight-start
gmod_mcore_test 1
